# Number-authentication-system_Deep-learning
This repository implements a deep learning-based voice number authentication system using CNN and a Siamese Network. It verifies spoken numbers by comparing voice embeddings to reference samples. The model extracts audio features (MFCC, spectrogram) using CNN and determines similarity through a Siamese architecture.
